# Knot Theory

This repository contains the code I have created during the Spring 2021 semester for undergraduate research done with Dr. Thomas Kindred on knot theory.

## Scripts

Within the `scripts/` directory you will find the actual code. The files are:

* `convert.py`: This contains two python functions, one that converts a DT Code to a Gauss Code, and one that converts a Gauss Code to a DT Code.

* `generate_gauss.py`: This contains two python functions, one to generate all possible Gauss Codes from a given Gauss Code, and another function used to "relabel" the generated codes in order to keep them in the correct format.

* `util.py`: This contains a simple python function that converts an array to a string in a pretty way.

**Research is still currently underway, more will be added as I go!**
